# Code-Analyzer
Work by Siva Kiran and Nataraj

We categorised the files which follows the typical IntelliJ IDEA project sturcture.
The file named "CodeAnalyzer.java" has the 'main()' method. If IntelliJ IDEA is not available,
just use this class to run the project, without changing the file locations.
Changing locations will lead to errors, as we set the packages accordingly.

This code works perfectly on jdk 1.7 and above (will support few older versions as well)


Setting up the project:

Select the option "download zip" which is available at https://github.com/sivakiran33/Code-Analyzer.git
That should download a zip file to the computer. Unzip the file to view files.


How to run:

The development must be test driven. So, make sure that all the methods have a space before opening the brackets.

In the project files, go to src\com\company
Compile the file named CodeAnalyzer.java
The code should compile with no errors and display the output.

# Code-Analyzer
Work by Siva Kiran and Nataraj

We categorised the files which follows the typical IntelliJ IDEA project sturcture.
The file named "CodeAnalyzer.java" has the 'main()' method. If IntelliJ IDEA is not available,
just use this class to run the project, without changing the file locations.
Changing locations will lead to errors, as we set the packages accordingly.

This code works perfectly on jdk 1.7 and above (will support few older versions as well)


How to run:

In the project files, go to src\com\company
Compile the file named CodeAnalyzer.java
The code should compile with no errors and display the output.
